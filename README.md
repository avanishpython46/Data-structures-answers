When I try to find number 5 in below list using binary search, it doesn't work and returns me -1 index. Why is that?

numbers = [1,4,6,9,10,5,7]
in this list binary search does not work because 9 is the middle part only 10 is bigger than middle form the right list except all are smaller than 9 
that s why it returned -1.
